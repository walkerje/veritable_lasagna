# **Introduction**
Welcome to the **Veritable Lasagna** manual!
Veritable Lasagna is a modern, modular, and portable toolkit for C programmers, offering high-quality data structures and algorithms with a strong focus on efficiency and clarity. Designed for use with C11, this library aims to fill gaps left by the standard library, providing powerful primitives commonly found in higher-level languages, but with a clean and approachable interface tailored for C projects of any size.
## **Key Features**
- **Comprehensive Data Structures:**
Includes dynamic arrays, stacks, queues, deques, linked lists, sets, and hash tables—each with both standard and thread-safe variants.
- **Advanced Memory Management:**
Provides arenas and pools that improve allocation speed and deterministic resource management.
- **Threading and Concurrency:**
Supplies atomic types, mutexes, and lock-free asynchronous containers for building robust multithreaded applications.
- **Serialization Support:**
Integrates MessagePack for compact, fast object serialization and deserialization.
- **Modern C:**
Written in clear, standards-compliant C11 with a focus on low dependencies and portability.
- **MIT Licensed:**
Freely available for both commercial and personal use.

## **Philosophy**
Veritable Lasagna is designed to be practical and unintrusive. Whether you are developing embedded firmware, a new desktop tool, or server infrastructure, this library helps you avoid “reinventing the wheel” for common programming tasks—without tying your project to complex external dependencies or requiring C++.
**Key goals:**
- Favor explicit control and zero-overhead abstractions.
- Support both classic procedural and modern idiomatic C styles.
- Allow seamless opt-in for thread safety and custom memory management.

## **When to Use Veritable Lasagna**
Use Veritable Lasagna if you need:
- Battle-tested data structures and utilities in your C project
- Rapid prototyping of complex, data-driven applications
- Tools for multithreaded programming without external runtime or bloat
- A clean, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns
